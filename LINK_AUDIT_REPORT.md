## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Replace all 15 Marginalian/Brain Pickings links** with primary sources or working alternatives
2. **Remove or replace all 11 organism.earth links** - site structure changed completely
3. **Update all 7 Verso Books product links** - check current site structure
4. **Replace 5 Wisdom Library links** with alternatives (Sacred Texts, IEP, Access to Insight)
5. **Manually verify 37 bot-blocked (403) links** in a browser

### Long-term Strategy:

1. **Prefer primary sources** over aggregators (e.g., link to Watts's own writings, not articles about them)
2. **Use stable academic sources**: SEP, IEP, ArXiv, JSTOR DOIs
3. **Favor institutional pages** over personal blogs
4. **Archive critical links** using Archive.org's Wayback Machine
5. **Add link checking** to CI/CD pipeline
6. **Document link intent** so future replacements maintain semantic equivalence

### Priority Order:

1. **P0 - Critical (do now):** Marginalian, organism.earth, Verso (33 links)
2. **P1 - High (do soon):** Wisdom Library, Aeon, SEP (16 links)
3. **P2 - Medium (verify):** 403 blocked links, manually check (37 links)
4. **P3 - Low (as needed):** Connection failures, investigate (20 links)
