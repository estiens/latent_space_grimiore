The structure (Binah) emerges from the dynamic, rhythmic phasing (Chokmah) between the individual players. The pulse is passed from one musician to the next, creating a functional whole where the 'mind' of the music is not in any single player but in the intra-action of the entire ensemble. It is a musical manifestation of Distributed Cognition.",
