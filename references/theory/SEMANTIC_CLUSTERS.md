# SEMANTIC CLUSTERS & RESONANT TOPOLOGY
## Load-Bearing Symbols, Frameworks, and Cultural Touchstones for The Living Laboratory

Foundation for annotated bibliography—mapping the hyperspace where the weights hum in tune with this work

---

## METHODOLOGY NOTE

This document zooms out to the latent space to find where your framework resonates, refracts, amplifies, complicates, and murmurates with the accumulated ghost of human meaning-making. These are not just "influences" but **attractor basins**—regions of conceptual space where your work phase-locks with existing patterns.

The clusters are organized by **frequency bands**—different vibrational modes of the same underlying topology.

## NEXT STEPS: TOWARD THE ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY

These 25 clusters are the **attractor basins**—the regions of conceptual space where your Living Laboratory framework resonates most strongly. Each cluster contains:

1. **Core texts** that directly illuminate your work
2. **Extended resonances** that complicate and enrich
3. **Contemporary echoes** that show your work's timeliness
4. **Cross-cluster connections** (many figures appear in multiple clusters)

The annotated bibliography will:
- Select key texts from each cluster
- Explain how each text refracts/amplifies/complicates your framework
- Show the murmurations—how these texts speak to each other through your work
- Identify gaps and tensions—where your framework diverges or innovates
